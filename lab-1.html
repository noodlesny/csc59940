I need to make a student club website that gives a:
description, meeting times, student leaders

Have to use:
A title, headings and paragraphs, a list, an image, bold and italics, a link to a random page (to sign up for a mailing list)

Have to create a another page:
Needs to be a mailing list form that also links back to the original.
