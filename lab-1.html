  		<h3> About Us</h3>
		<p> We are a group of like-minded students that get together to exchange items with each other.
		<br>Books, clothes, your grandma's old tube TV- it's all fair game. If you can get it here, they can get it out! 

		<p>Who should join? Anyone that likes:
		<ul style="display:inline-block; text-align: left;">
			<li> Reducing waste and giving useful items a second chance </li>
			<li> Finding treasure in others' trash </li>
			<li> Getting to know students that aren't in their forced class groups </li>
			<li> Minimizing their risk of ending up on Hoarders </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>Swap Times:</h3>
